# codeclause_mask_detection 
Real time face-mask detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV

## About Project
This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. The CNN manages to get an accuracy of 91.74% on the training set and 91.6% on the test set. Then the stored weights of this CNN are used to classify as mask or no mask.
The model is capable of predicting multiple faces with or without masks at the same time

## Dataset
The data used can be downloaded through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset) or can be downloaded from this repository as well . There are 3725 and 3828 images with and without mask simuntanously
